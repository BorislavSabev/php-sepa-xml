# Development

## PHP dependencies
Just run `composer install` and you will get phpunit and dependencies in place.
 
## Contributing
Contributions are really welcome. But it saves time for both sides when at least the travis builds do not fail.
We will not accept newly added fields/features without full test coverage in the PR.
